%--------------------Introduction ---------------------------------------
\section{Introduction}
The Software Verification and Validation Specification (SVVS) describes all tests and reviews conducted during the development of the project. The SVVS acts as a base for the SVVI (Software Verification and Validation Instructions).
In the SVVS, there are instructions for reviews as well as information about what types of tests should be performed and by whom. In the appendices, test cases are specified.

%--------------------Testing ---------------------------------------
\section{Testing}
In order to validate and verify that the system fulfills the customers requirements, various tests are conducted during the development phases. Types of test i.e. unit tests, function tests etc. can be divided into two categories: white-box tests and black-box tests, which are described below. Both of these should be performed.

The tests specified in this document are mapped to the requirements (in ref. \ref{refdocs:srs}) via test matrices (see ref. \ref{refdocs:matrices}).

\subsection{White-box Testing}
In a white-box test the developer tests the internal structure of the system, by means of making sure that all lines/units of code are executed at least once. These are performed by the developer group during development.

\subsection{Black-box Testing}
A function test or black-box test examines the functionality of a system from an external point of view. Combinations of input data are chosen and the output data from the system is compared to a specification.


%--------------------Reviews ---------------------------------------
\section{Reviews}

\subsection{Formal Reviews}
Formal reviews are conducted according to reference \ref{refdocs:projekthandledning}.

The scheduled formal reviews, and the documents up for review, in this project are:

\begin{enumerate}

\item Software Specification Review (SSR)
\begin{itemize}
\item SDP
\item SRS
\item SVVS
\end{itemize}


\item Preliminary Design Review (PDR)
\begin{itemize}
\item SVVI
\item STLDD
\end{itemize}


\item Product Review (PR)
\begin{itemize}
\item SVVR
\item SSD
\item PFR
\end{itemize}


\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Informal Reviews}
Informal reviews are to be held before the deadline for the formal review, with enough time to correct any problems found during the informal review. The documents up for review should be made available in the project library at least 24 hours before the informal review.

PG are the responsible coordinators for the informal review.

%--------------------Test environments ---------------------------------------
\section{Test Environments}
All tests specified in this document should be performed on appropriate emulator software. If possible, the tests should also be run on a physical device.

%--------------------Test cases ----------------------------------------------
\section{Types of Tests}

\subsection{Unit Tests}
The developer group should perform unit tests, both black-box tests and white-box tests. These tests should be performed continuously during development.

\subsection{Function Tests}
All functions of the system should be tested according to appendix \ref{appendix:section:functiontest}. The test group is responsible for  performing these tests.

\subsection{System Tests}
The entire system should be tested according to appendix \ref{appendix:section:systemtest}. The test group is responsible for performing these tests. 

\subsection{Regression Tests}
After any changes, all system tests should be performed again to ensure that previously functional code is still working. The test group is responsible for performing these tests.

\subsection{Acceptance Tests}
Acceptance tests are performed by the costumer before completion of the project. The costumer is responsible for selecting tests to ensure that the software meets their demands.
