\section{Introduction}
This document contains the test instructions for the tests specified in PUSS154213 (ref. \ref{redocs:SVVS}). The test instructions are in appendices \ref{appendix:section:functiontest} and \ref{appendix:section:systemtest}. The numbering corresponds to that in the SVVS (ref. \ref{redocs:SVVS}).
% should the references have "Ref." instead? We have used both in the SVVS...

\subsection{Terminology}
\begin{description}
\item[Device available] is used when a device is connected to the MVD.
\item[Swiping] or \textbf{to drag} is a meant to be a relatively smooth motion with a finger (or similar device) on the screen of the telephone.
\item[Off] or \textbf{On} refers to the device's state of transmitting data, not whether the device is receiving electrical power or not.
\item[Light bulb] refers to the physical object that shines that we can interact with. While the \textbf{Light} refers to photons emitted from the  \textit{light bulb}.
\item[Controlled environment] refers to a environment where we can control at least one of the following physical observables:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Temperature
	\item Pressure
	\item Humidty
	\item Magnetic field
	\item Gyroscopic data
	\item Acceleration
	\end{itemize}
\item[Environmental variable] refers to one of the physical observables listed above.
\item[Scenario], this means the corresponding scenario in \ref{refdocs:srs}.

\section{Function Test Instructions} \label{appendix:section:functiontest}
This is appendix \ref{appendix:section:functiontest} where we list all function test instructions.

%How much should we imply? Is it "touch" a thing or is it "press" a button; should we specify how to select a device from a list by saying "touch the name of the device in the list" or should we just say "select"
