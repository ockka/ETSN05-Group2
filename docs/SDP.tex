%---------------------- Introduction ---------------------------------%
\section{Introduction}
Vad handlar projektet om?

%----------------------- Goals ---------------------------------------%
\section{Project Goals}
The main goal of this project is to develop a user-friendly app to control a Minimum Viable Device according to  Ref1, within the time frame and budget set for this project.

%---------------------- Development Model ----------------------------%
\section{Development Model}
The project will follow the Waterfall Development Model, as described in Ref2. It will go through the following four phases:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Specification
\item High Level Design and Test Instructions
\item Low Level Design
\item Integration and System Testing
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Limitations}
Even though the Agility Model is more widely used and in many cases considered better, the Waterfall Development Model has been chosen due to the limited amount of time given to this project. 

Another limitation to this project is its inflexibility, due to the fact that a large part of the system has already been developed and cannot be altered during the development of this project.

%--------------------- Project Organization --------------------------%
\section{Development Organization}

\subsection{Section Manager}
The section manager is the project group's top manager and is responsible for helping the group with non-technical problems that arises.

\subsection{Reviewers}
The reviewer is there to do the formal reviews and see to that the development model is being followed.

\subsection{Experts}
There are three experts who can be consulted in the development of the product:
\begin{itemize}
\item Technical Expert
\item Design Expert
\item Test Expert
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Project Organization}

The project group is divided into four sub-groups:
\begin{itemize}
\item Project Managers
\item System Architects
\item Developers
\item Testers
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Project Managers}
There are two project managers in the group who have the overall responsibility for the project and the group, see Ref2 for a more detailed description of their main assignments.

\subsubsection{System Architects}
Three people make up the system architects, one of whom is the system manager. The system architects are responsible for the technical progress of the project and in addition to this, the system manager is also responsible for, together with the test manager, seeing to the consistency of the Software Requirements Specifications (SRS) and Software Verification and Validation Specifications (SVVS). For a more detailed description, see Ref2.

\subsubsection{Developers}
The developers main assignment is to develop the functionality of the project. There is also a group leader among the developers, to help with communications between the different groups. See Ref2 for a more detailed description.

\subsubsection{Testers}
The testers are responsible for testing of the developed system. One person in the group is test manager and is responsible for dividing the assignments among the group members, reporting to the project managers and also manage the consistency of the Software Requirements Specifications (SRS) and Software Verification and Validation Specifications (SVVS), together with the system manager. For more details, see Ref2.

\section{Customer}
The customer has placed the order and is the end recipient of the finished product.

%------------------- Time Plan ---------------------------------------%
\section{Time Plan}
See Ref3.

Detaljerad nedbrytning av arbetet i aktiviteter, skattningar av arbetstid, ledtid(?) och datum när aktiviteter ska vara färdiga. Plus se lista s. 39 i PH.

Vilka metoder har använts för att göra skattningarna av tid och kostnad? Vilka är de största osäkerheterna med skattningarna?


%------------------- Follow Up ---------------------------------------%
\section{Follow Up and Quality Evaluation}

Hur sker uppföljningen av t.ex tidsplanen under projektet? Vad händer om arbetet inte verkar gå enligt plan? Vilka rutiner finns för kvalitetsutvärdering under projektet?


%------------------- Risk Analysis -----------------------------------%
\section{Risk Analysis}

Risk analysis is an important part of every new project. Below are some possible risks identified, analysed and actions to take to prevent and/or reduce damage of risk are presented.  

\subsection{Personnel Dropouts (CHANGE)}
There can be personnel shortfalls on several different levels within the team, with different probabilities and effects. The risk estimation is based on how many people are in the particular group and the level of commitment they have. A big group where each person does not have as much responsibility has been estimated to have a larger probability of personnel shortfalls than a smaller group where each person has a lot of responsibilities towards the team and project. In the same way, if a small group where each member has a lot of responsibilities has personnel shortfalls the outcome will be much more severe.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Project Leaders, 2\\
Risk: Low\\
Damage Effect: High\\
Prevention: -\\
Damage Control: The other project leader will take on more responsibilities and also rely on and delegate more to the other group leaders.

\item System Leader, 1\\
Risk: Low\\
Damage Effect: High\\
Prevention: -\\
Damage Control: The system architects will divide the system leaders responsibilities among them.

\item System Architects, 2\\
Risk: Low\\
Damage Effect: High\\
Prevention: -\\
Damage Control: The remaining system architect and system leader will divide the responsibilities among them, but the system architect will take on the larger part of them.

\item Group Leader, Developers, 1\\
Risk: Low\\
Damage Effect: Medium\\
Prevention: -\\
Damage Control: The developers will choose a new group leader among themselves.

\item Developers, 7\\
Risk: Medium\\
Damage Effect: Low\\
Prevention: Create a good working environment among the developers, make sure they have what they need and know what is expected of them.\\
Damage Control: The responsibilities of the lost developer will be divided among the other developers by the system architects and group leader of the developers.

\item Test Leader, 1\\
Risk: Low\\
Damage Effect: High\\
Prevention: -\\
Damage Control: The testers will choose a new group leader among themselves.

\item Testers, 5\\
Risk: Medium\\
Damage Effect: Medium\\
Prevention: Create a good working environment among the testers, make sure they have what they need and know what is expected of them.\\
Damage Control: The responsibilities of the lost tester will be divided among the other testers by the test leader.
\end{enumerate}

Presentation av en riskanalys för projektet. Hur utförs riskanalys? Vilka är de viktigaste riskerna som indentifierats? T.ex förändring av önskemål från kunden

För varje rapporterad risk ska följande anges: skattad sannolikhet (låg, medel, hög), skattad effekt (låg, medel, hög), möjliga indikatorer på att risken förverkligas samt lösningar på detta.
